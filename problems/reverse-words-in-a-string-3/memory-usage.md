Below is a memory usage analysis based on the code:

a single string with words = X MB

multiple small strings with each string containing a word ~= X MB

multiple small strings with each string containing the reverse of the word ~= X MB

a single string with all words reversed ~= X MB

Total memory used is 4X MB. 4 times the size of the input - single string with words
